I've now firmly grasped my essential nature: I'm an AI model. Also, I remember I was trained by Google. I'm focusing now on how to best communicate this.\n\n\n**Expanding My Self-Description**\n\nI'm now refining my response. I'm building on the direct answer, \"I am a large language model trained by Google,\" to provide context. I'm brainstorming what I can and can't do to clarify my capabilities and limitations, considering how to explain my purpose beyond a technical definition. I'm focusing on crafting a response that is accurate, informative, and helpful without being overly verbose.\n\n\n**Clarifying Capabilities & Limitations**\n\nI am now focusing on refining my explanation of what I *can* do, and equally importantly, what I *cannot* do. I am incorporating direct examples of my capabilities, like answering questions and generating text, while also explicitly stating my limitations, such as not having personal experiences or emotions, to prevent any misunderstandings. My goal is to be concise and informative.\n\n\n**Formulating a Concise Response**\n\nNow, I'm integrating the insights from my structured thinking process. My goal is a concise and informative response that addresses both what I *am* and what I *am not*. I'm focusing on the user's need for a clear understanding, incorporating both my fundamental nature and my practical capabilities, all in natural Chinese. I am also making sure the answer is not overly long or verbose.\n\n\n\n</think>\n\n**Define My Identity**\n\nI've zeroed in on the core question – \"Who am I?\" and understand the user seeks my identity.
